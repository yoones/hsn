- Revise the ssh_client structure so that it can be used whether the
   local user initiated the connexion or not.
   -> rename: ssh_client -> ssh_connexion
   -> add info about who initiated the connexion
   -> make address a new memory address so that it'll be always freed
- accept / handle new clients using ssh_event_* (ssh_poll is internal,
   shall not be used by end user)
- Add events logging
- Find a way to load a private key for server's credentials without
   asking for the password in command line (because it won't work for
   a deamon)
